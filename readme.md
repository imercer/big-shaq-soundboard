# Man's Not Hot - Big Shaq Soundboard
Big Shaq, hold tight, Asnee
Scoopnum, ratnum, oosna
Hold tight the girl-dem as well, boom


Two plus two is four, minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack, you man were ducking
Hold tight, Asnee, he's got the pumpy
Hold tight, my man, he's got the frisbee
I trap, trap, trap on the road, movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispie, hold tight, my girl Whitney (perfect)
On the road doin' ten toes, lamma toes
You man thought I froze, I see a peng girl, then I pose
If she's not on it, I ghost, hah, look at your nose
What? You dickhead! Look at your nose
Nose long like garden hose, shhh, you get me?


Hop out the four-door with the .44, it was one, two, three and four
Chillin' in the corridor, your dad is forty-four
And he's still callin' man for a draw, let him know
When I see him, I'm gonna spin his jaw
Take man's Twix by force, send man shop by force
Your girl knows I've got the sauce, no ketchup
Just sauce, raw sauce
Boom, yo, gah
The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skibiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom
You dun know, Big Shaq, ha, yo, yeah-yeah
Alright, fire-fire-fire in the booth
You get me, man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot, hah, cot
I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot"
Yo, man can never be hot
Perspiration ting, Lynx effect


Yo, you dun know
